# 發願
我在此世界發願，願助人類了解聲明之重要性。了解咒語對身體影嚮。
發願聽梵音準提咒,準提咒有經證是聽聞就能減罪。咒語的發音很重要。
發音影嚮心理及生理，此外還包含佛的願力。佛名如果不是梵音，或許少了音聲的助緣。也許，佛立佛名的目地,就是如果正確的音聲失傳，至少佛的願力也可起作用。
咒語帶有願力，還有護法願力，還有音聲的功德。據說陀羅尼是最上，是否因為音聲是個大助緣? 耳根圓通章也說，這世界的生靈的耳根是利根。

如果說精進修法，不敢說如法修法。如果只是單純的不如法修法，能夠大精進的就是用耳根，用聽的. mp3 耳機可以晚上睡時，小聲聽8小時。這樣一般有好耳機的人，也可以做到每日精進8小時了。

# 聽咒語，佛號是否有功德?
- 我們來獨立思考，研究這問題。首先，"聽咒語，佛號是否有功德?"這句話真正的意思是，能否從聽咒語及佛號這件事中得到一些好處或利益.
 大家都認同適當的運動及好的生活習慣是對身體有好處，而且要每日一直持續做適當的運動及好的生活習慣才能保持一直得到對身體健康的好處及利益. 
 如果每日不再持續適當的運動及好的生活習慣，漸漸，日子久了，一個月又一個月或一年又一年後，身體會漸漸變沒有當時每日一直持續做適當的運動及好的生活習慣的健康狀態了。

- 同理，聽咒語及佛號也是如此。但咒語及佛號感覺不科學，而且是迷信或某種超自然力量來主導，有可能從這件事中得到一些好處或利益嗎? 針對這點，我們來獨立思考，到底咒語跟佛號科學嗎? 
如果是科學,到底可能的科學原理是什麼? 咒語及佛號是音聲，我們生活中，有一直持續聽音聲而得到一些好處或利益的例子，並有科學證明嗎? 有的，如聽音樂. 不同的音樂. 同理可證，聽音聲這件事中能得到一些好處或利益,而咒語及佛號是音聲，

### I tried listening to positive affirmations each morning and this weird thing happened

Positive affirmations have always been popular among the personal development and law of attraction crowd—but like mindfulness and meditation, the practice has been coming more and more commonplace as more folks start placing emphasis on having a healthy mindset and positive outlook.
According to a recent study by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, practicing affirmations—whether listening to pre-recordings or creating your own, it helps lower stress by alleviating perceptions of threat and defensiveness by expanding self worth through broader dispositional self-views.
In other words, when you make the effort to think about positive outcomes, your brain begins to feel as if the outcomes have already occurred.
While listening to or voicing positive affirmations require regular practice and long-term commitment in order to really start changing the way you think and feel, becoming aware of your daily thoughts and words while reducing the chances of negativity creeping in has immediate benefits.
Here’s what happened when I listened to positive affirmations each morning for a week—and why I’ll continue weaving the practice into my morning routine.

#### Day One
While I love self development and personal growth, I’m always a little bit skeptical when trying a new practice. I’m definitely not someone who gives myself verbal pep talks or leaves written affirmations on my bathroom mirror so getting into the right headspace for this was a bit of a challenge in itself.
With that in mind, I decided to curate a Spotify playlist of pre-recorded affirmations about money mindset, the law of attraction, and general gratitude rather than trying to speak them myself—and I would definitely recommend going that route before trying to record or verbalize my own personalized affirmations.

#### Day Two
By the second day I actually looked forward to listening to my affirmations. I popped in my earbuds when I first woke up and listened to my short playlist before even getting out of bed. I usually grab my phone and immediately start checking my emails and scrolling through social media so the practice instantly helped me ‘wake up on the right side of the bed’ so to speak.

#### Day Three
Honestly, I can’t believe how easy it was to stop scrolling on social media when I started listening to these affirmations.
Instead of waking up crabby, worried about my workload for the day, and quietly judging strangers on social media, I looked forward to having a coffee in bed, enjoying my partner’s company, and thinking about all the potential the day has to offer.

#### Day Four
I actually fell asleep during the affirmations this morning—which wasn’t my intention at all, but there’s a ton of construction going on outside my building and I guess trying to listen to affirmations at 6 am just isn’t my thing.
That said, during my weird interrupted morning nap, I ended up dreaming about the exact affirmations I was listening to. I don’t think that’s at all how you’re supposed to practice morning affirmations but I still woke up in a pretty decent mood—even in spite of the annoying construction outside.


#### Day Five
By the last day, I had genuinely noticed a shift in my mood in the morning and well into the day. I’m admittedly a huge crab before I’ve had coffee but listening to affirmations helped me start the day with gratitude and a sense of hope that the day will be filled with fun and happiness.
As cheesy as it sounds, listening to the affirmations and explicitly choosing to believe in what I was listening to rather than laughing through it or only seeing it for face value felt genuinely uplifting.
I also love that it finally helped me kick my morning time social media scrolling and rather helped me focus on enjoying the morning and really being present.
